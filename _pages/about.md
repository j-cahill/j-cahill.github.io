I'm a part time MS student in data science at Columbia University (Graduating May 2020) with professional experience in Bioengineering, and Social Epidemiological data analysis. Most of my personal data science projects are based on my hobbies and interests, like music and cooking.

I excel at data wrangling from messy sources and using my results to tell an interesting and compelling story and place a special emphasis on good programming practices.
