I'm a data analyst and public health researcher at the Columbia University
Mailman School of Public Health, and a part time MS student in data science
at Columbia. Most of my personal data science projects are based on my hobbies
and interests, like music and cooking.

I excel at data wrangling from messy sources and using my results to tell an
interesting and compelling story.
